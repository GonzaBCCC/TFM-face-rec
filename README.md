# TFM-face-rec

This is a face-rec project including functions such as:

-Frontalized faces database construction.

To build a frontalized database starting form a database such as MIT-CBCL faces dataset, it makes use of face-frontalization module by dougsouza in order to process every caption and build a database for face recognition with frontalization preprocess already performed.

Face-frontalization in python version is courtesy of dougsouza:
