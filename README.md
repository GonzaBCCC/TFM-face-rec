# TFM-face-rec

This is a face-rec project including functions to build a frontalized database starting form adatabase such as MIT-CBCL faces dataset (http://cbcl.mit.edu/software-datasets/heisele/facerecognition-database.html). Credit is hereby given to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and to the Center for Biological and Computational Learning for providing the database of facial images. 

For more information on the database refer to:
